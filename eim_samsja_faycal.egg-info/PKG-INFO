Description: # EIM Package ( Empirical Interpolation Method) 
        
        This packages is the implmentation of the [EIM (Empirical Interpolation Method) algorithm](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00174797/document). This algorithm is a dimensionality reduction algorithm. It can be used to preprocess some data before creating regression or classification models or any type of machine learning algo based on data. The main advantage of eim is that we can choose a desired precision is the compresion of the data information. The idea is to project each lines in an reduced interpolation based with is compute with magic points that are choosen as the worst interpolate points and correct at each new step of the algo.
        
        
        
        This packages is written in python and use Pytorch as a backend, the computation can be accelerated by uwing GPU (check docs to use it)
        
        The algorithm has been first introduce in this [2007 paper](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00174797/document) :
